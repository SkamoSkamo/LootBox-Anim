The buttons on the left side are for selecting the chests. The top button selects the **basic** chest, and the bottom one the **rare** ( do not be fooled by their identical appearence. )
Clicking on the actual chest plays the respective animations. When the chest opens a placehodler cube is displayed, use your imagination to make of it whatever you would like to see,
clicking on the cube will reset the chest selection process.
